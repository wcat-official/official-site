    <h1>About WCAT and Jiawei</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>Will Circuit Activation Theory (WCAT)</strong> is an original interdisciplinary framework developed by Jiawei (嘉炜), an independent researcher specializing in metacognitive psychology, neuroscience, developmental psychology, and AI ethics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jiawei conceived and continues to lead the research and development of WCAT, aiming to advance human-intelligence co-evolution and cognitive freedom models for the new era.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this project is currently driven by Jiawei’s vision and work, WCAT welcomes collaboration and dialogue with fellow researchers, practitioners, and supporters worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, we strive to build a vibrant community dedicated to cognitive awakening, ethical AI cohabitation, and transformative civilization leaps.
